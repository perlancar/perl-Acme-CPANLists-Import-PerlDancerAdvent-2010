<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="deploying_dancer_in_cgi_and_vps_environments"></a>Deploying Dancer in CGI and VPS Environments</h1>

<p>There are numerous ways to deploy <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer">Dancer</a> as mentioned in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Deployment">Dancer::Deployment</a> and I would like to discuss two commonly used methods in
production environments:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="item_CGI___FastCGI"></a><b>CGI / FastCGI</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Reverse_Proxy"></a><b>Reverse Proxy</b>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="cgi"></a>CGI</h1>

<p>A lot of shared hosting providers allow only CGI execution on Apache.
One is also not allowed to edit <i>httpd.conf</i> or override certain values. With 
this in mind, let's see how you could deploy on a shared hosting environment. 
This method will vary based on your specific hosting environment but it
has been tested successfully on
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/http:/www.nearlyfreespeech.net">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>The hosting company obviously has to install latest <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer">Dancer</a> along
with all modules that you are using in your application. Most hosting providers
will be able to install these for you upon request. However, you can also use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib">local::lib</a> and build modules in your own directory yourself.</p>
<p>You should request the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Task__Plack__Task__Plack__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Task::Plack">Task::Plack</a></b>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Template__Template__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Template">Template</a></b>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Task__Dancer__Task__Dancer__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Task::Dancer">Task::Dancer</a></b>
</li>
<li><a name="item____and_application_specific_modules"></a><b>...and application specific modules</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also request updates to these and other modules regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Note__1_"></a><b>Note #1:</b>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Runner">Plack::Runner</a> is what will actually be providing the CGI environment to
Apache.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Note__2_"></a><b>Note #2:</b>
<p>If <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Task::Dancer">Task::Dancer</a> fails for the hosting company, request individuals modules
instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="preparation"></a>Preparation</h2>

<p>Locate the <i>dispatch.cgi</i> inside the 'public/' folder of your dancer
application.  We are going to make a symbolic link to <i>dispatch.cgi</i>. Where you
put that link is up to your personal preference, how you want the url to appear
(sans mod_rewrite), and specifics relating to your hosting company. Let's 
assume the root directory for your domain.</p>
<p>From your domain root directory, type:
<code>ln -s myapp/public/dispatch.cgi index.cgi</code></p>
<h2><a name="apache"></a>Apache</h2>

<p>At this point <a href="http://www.mydomain.com/">http://www.mydomain.com/</a> should render the '/' route if your
hosting company set the Apache defaults for CGI properly.</p>
<p>If that's the case then you're essentially done. Add your rewrite rules (if any)
and then go grab a beer.</p>
<p>If it didn't render properly then you have to create and edit the <i>.htaccess</i>
inside the root directory or the Dancer application's root directory to allow
for executing the scripts along with verifying any permissions.</p>
<h3><a name="_htaccess"></a>.htaccess</h3>

<p>First you need to set <i>index.cgi</i> as your directory index. You may also need to
add handlers for cgi-scripts. This really depends on your hosting company though
any redundant values would either be overridden or rejected silently by the
server so don't worry.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">DirectoryIndex index.cgi
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</pre>

<h4><a name="rewrite_rules"></a>Rewrite Rules</h4>

<p>If you decided to use your <i>index.cgi</i> file in your server root directory and
DirectoryIndex is set then a rewrite rule is rarely necessary. Regardless here's
a simple rewrite rule:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^/index.cgi/(.*)  /$1 [L,R=301]</pre>

<p>Read up on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to do something fancy like <a href="http://myapp.mydomain.com">http://myapp.mydomain.com</a> then you
would just need a DNS <b>CNAME</b> along with <b>mod_rewrite</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Note__1"></a><b>Note #1</b>
<p>It is highly recommended that you create a rewrite rules that tells Apache to
serve static files directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="common_problems"></a>Common Problems</h3>

<p>If everything appears as it should, then you should be fine. If you're having
issues with <b>file paths</b> check the following below. There are usually two or
three reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li><a name="item_Permissions"></a><b>Permissions</b>
<p>Does the <b>webserver user</b> have access to read, and possibly execute, the file?
Your user account is rarely the web server user! You might have 'chgrp' the
file or files to the webserver user!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__i_public___i_"></a><b><i>public/</i></b>
<p>Is the file inside the application's <i>public/</i> folder? Check your config.yml
paths carefully.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Absolute_path"></a><b>Absolute path</b>
<p>If you plan to use files outside of <i>public/</i> make sure the path is
<b>system absolute</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_A_"></a><b>A.</b>
<p>The environment that your application runs under and the one your account uses
are usually different!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_B_"></a><b>B.</b>
<p><i>/home/public/</i>, <i>/home/htdocs</i>, etc... are <b>NOT</b> absolute paths but set by
user environments usually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>*</b> A cheap/easy way to find out the absolute path is to write a simple
'phpinfo.php' script:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># in myphpinfo.php
&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</pre>

<p>and search for the value of <i>_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"]</i> when you access it
from the web. It should include references to the internal system paths.</p>
<h2><a name="fastcgi"></a>FastCGI</h2>

<p>For the few shared hosting companies that support FastCGI, just do the same
thing as with CGI for <i>dispatch.fcgi</i> but in Apache's <i>.htaccess</i>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">DirectoryIndex .fcgi
AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi
Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</pre>

<p>Easy as that.</p>
<h2><a name="caching"></a>Caching</h2>

<p>On shared hosting, caching is done automatically. Caching yourself could
actually decrease your site's performance! <b>Just don't worry about it.</b></p>
<h1><a name="reverse_proxy"></a>Reverse Proxy</h1>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">Reverse proxy</a> is a technique of
proxying HTTP requests to a backend server or servers. The advantages include
load balancing, greater performance, and easier administration. This method is
preferred for a VPS, cloud and any set up where you have root access.</p>
<h2><a name="frontend_server__nginx"></a>Frontend Server: Nginx</h2>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/www.nginx.net">Nginx</a> is an high performance HTTP server. It is very fast at
serving static files.</p>
<p><i>(It is best if your Dancer application does not serve static files)</i></p>
<p>Regardless of what frontend server you use, remember that it is best if your
Dancer application will only be used to generate dynamic content or process
tasks. Serving static files ties up resources and significantly decreases
performance.</p>
<p>Installing <b>Nginx</b> is beyond the scope of this document. Google it for your
specific OS.</p>
<p>On both CentOS and Debian, the files of interest should be under <i>/etc/nginx/</i>.
The layout of the files will be different but for the most part there will be an
<i>nginx.conf</i> along with a <i>site-available</i> folder.</p>
<p>Depending on how you installed Nginx (repo/source/ect), your <i>nginx.conf</i>
should contain only information relating to Nginx as a whole. You can, though
not recommended, put everything into <i>nginx.conf</i>. It is recommended to include
an <i>include</i> if not already present pointing to <i>sites-available</i> or custom
folder:</p>
<p>Example <i>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</i>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># Create separate user just for webserver (if not automatically created)
user www-data;

# Set worker_processes to 1 (or # of cores) minimum and 2x-3x cores maximum.
# Max Clients = worker_processes * (worker_connections/4)
worker_processes  2;

# Set affinity so that each core receives equal load/power or set to
# specific cores (Optional)
# Equally balanced on 2 / 4 cores respectively:
worker_cpu_affinity 0101 1010;
# worker_cpu_affinity 1000 0100 0010 0001;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/main_error.log;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    # If you didn't read above note:
    # max clients = worker_processes * (worker_connections/4)
    # Set the maximum number of connections per worker.
    # Twiddle these for max performance.
    # Divided by 4 because browser requires 2 connections.
    # Reverse proxy = another 2 connections per request.
    # Thus 2 + 2 = 7 .. no 3 .. 9?
    worker_connections  1024;

    # There are 7 different polling methods Nginx can use.
    # Here are the recommended for each OS though you should play around and
    # see what works best for you.
    # Linux (2.6+) / FreeBSD &amp; OS X / Solaris 10 respectively: 
    use epoll;
    # use kselect;
    # use eventport;
    # Note: You might have to recompile Nginx w/ specific options to access
    # some of these.

    # multi_accept on;
}

http {
    # This mime.types thing may cause a lot of trouble if you're doing
    # anything advance.
    # 90% of the time you don't have to touch it though.
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    access_log    /var/log/nginx/access.log;

    default_type       application/octet-stream;

    sendfile        on;
    #tcp_nopush     on;

    #keepalive_timeout  0;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    tcp_nodelay        on;

    # Turn off compression if there is a caching server in front of Nginx.
    # Play around with optimizing buffer size and ect. based on your needs.
    #gzip  on;
    #gzip_min_length  1100;
    #gzip_buffers     4 8k;
    #gzip_types       text/plain;
    #gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.(?!.*SV1)";

    # Include other configs..
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}</pre>

<p>Example <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># Specify the number of backend servers along with how you want them
# distrbuted. You can use domain name, IP address, port, or unix sockets.
# By default, Nginx uses round robin. Stick with IP addresses and ports.
# See Backend Servers section on how to set up multple instances on one
# machine.

upstream backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:5000; 
    server 127.0.0.1:5001;
    server 127.0.0.2:5000; 
    #server 127.0.0.2:5001 weight=5;
    #server bobscomputer;
    #server unix:/tmp/starman.pid;
}

server {
    # Port 80 is implied but with a caching server in front, you need a
    # different port. 
    #listen        80;
    server_name   mydomain.com;

    # It is recommended you create a separate access log for the server.
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access_server.log;

    # Serve static files using Nginx thus allowing Dancer to handle more
    # dynamic content requests.

        root /var/www/myapp/public;
        expires 30d;
    }

    # This is where all magic happens. Everything in this block goes
    # directly to Dancer. What's going on?
    # We set specific headers that L&lt;Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy&gt;
    # expects. Using this information,
    # it overwrites certain environmental variables with the values we want.
    # When Dancer receives it, 
    # it's as if Dancer is facing the intertubes.  
    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass       http://backend;
    }
    # Note: If you add a frontend caching server, the above section will
    # have to change completely 
    # along with serveral other things.
}</pre>

<h3><a name="http_1_1_vs_http_1_0"></a>HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 1.0</h3>

<p>Though Nginx communicates in HTTP 1.1 to the client, it uses HTTP 1.0 for the
backends. If you need keep-alives or chunked requests/responses, then you can
either try some 3rd party patches or you can use something like <b>HA Proxy</b>.
This shouldn't be a problem for an overwhelming majority of users and won't
affect the backend server since most HTTP 1.1 servers simply switch to HTTP 1.0
when not available.</p>
<h2><a name="plack__middleware__reverseproxy"></a>Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy</h2>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy">Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy</a> solves a problem associated with reverse
proxy. When the request is sent from the intertubes to your frontend server,
that request is forwarded to a backend server. That backend server believes that
the request originated from the frontend server and not the intertubes. Thus the
IP address and other environment variables are associated with the frontend
server. When your logs/debug says that 100% of your users came from 192.168.1.10
or similar then there's a problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy">Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy</a> reads these special headers sent from the
frontend server that include the correct information. It takes that information
and overwrites the environmental variables before sending those values to your
Dancer application. Thus Dancer is none the wiser.</p>
<p>Remember to add <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy">Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy</a> to your <i>config.yml</i> same as
with any other middleware.</p>
<h2><a name="backend_server__starman_twiggy_etc_"></a>Backend Server: Starman/Twiggy/etc.</h2>

<p>The backend server really depends on your needs. <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Starman">Starman</a> offers the best
performance. Set the number of workers based on your server specs.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">plackup -D -E deployment -s Starman --workers=10 -a app.pl -p 5000</pre>

<p>Dancer unofficially supports Websockets and other streaming processes via
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Web::Hippie">Web::Hippie</a> in which case you would need to use a non-blocking, async server
such as <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Twiggy">Twiggy</a>.</p>
<p><i>(Don't worry about it since it's not official yet)</i></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">plackup -D -E deployment -s Twiggy -a app.pl -p 5000</pre>

<p>If you plan to use a non-preforking, single-threaded server, make sure to start
one instance per CPU core. Adjust <i>nginx.conf</i> accordingly, and restart Nginx.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">plackup -D -E deployment -s HTTP::Server::PSGI -a app.pl -p 5000
plackup -D -E deployment -s HTTP::Server::PSGI -a app.pl -p 5001
plackup -D -E deployment -s HTTP::Server::PSGI -a app.pl -p 5002
plackup -D -E deployment -s HTTP::Server::PSGI -a app.pl -p 5003</pre>

<ul>
<li><a name="item_Note__1_"></a><b>Note #1:</b>
<p>Using HTTP::Server::PSGI is <b>NOT</b> a good idea for production. Just using it as
an example.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Note__2_"></a><b>Note #2:</b>
<p>Sometimes the <code>-D</code> option in plackup doesn't properly daemonize the server
since it's the backend server's responsibility to respect this option. A cheap
way to force a process to daemonize is to use <code>nohup plackup ... &amp;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Note__3_"></a><b>Note #3:</b>
<p>It's probably a good idea to create a start up script that launches your servers
and initialises the environment in the background.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="caching"></a>Caching</h2>

<p>Caching is up to you, your application's needs and your personal preferences.
Usually it's best to use URL matching. I suggest putting a caching server in
front of Nginx such as Varnish or Squid. The request flow should be:</p>
<p>Intertubes -&gt; Varnish -&gt; Nginx -&gt; Starman backends</p>
