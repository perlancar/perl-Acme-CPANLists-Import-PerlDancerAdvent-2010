The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="why_routes___route_based_programming_introduction"></a>Why routes - route-based programming introduction</h1>

<p>In this article, we'll try to explain the basic premise behind Dancer, to make
it easier for you to get started. That premise being
<i>route-based web programming</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="common_web_programming_models"></a>Common web programming models</h2>

<h3><a name="cgi"></a>CGI</h3>

<p>CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is arguably the most common web programming
model. Not because it's particularly good, but because it's the simplest to
write (something which is no longer true, thanks to Dancer, as we'll see later
on) and the easier to configure on a web server.</p>
<p>Mainly CGI web programming entails the web server running a script, providing
everything possible (such as request parameters) in the environment variable
(<code>%ENV</code>) and taking the standard output (<i>STDOUT</i>) and returning that to the
browser, except the first chunk which is used for internal browser usage (such
as declaring content type, setting cookies, noting redirects and so forth).</p>
<p>Every time a browser makes a request, the server runs the CGI script and gets
the information back to the browser. This is clearly very wasteful in resources.</p>
<p>This can give programmers a lot of hassle. For example, you need to purify your
environment variables, you need to print the content type (if you only provide
one chunk of content without the internal browser chunk), the web server will
crash your request and send the browser a 500 (Internal Server Error).</p>
<p>You have to understand what a user wanted by checking the parameters. Even if
use the great <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/CGI">CGI</a> module, you still need to write the entire logic behind
what should happen and when.</p>
<p>For example, to print the main page, you may write code such as this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;

my $cgi = CGI-&gt;new;
if ( my $page = $cgi-&gt;param('page') ) {
    if ( $page eq 'main' ) {
        print $cgi-&gt;header( charset =&gt; 'UTF-8' );
        # get main page and print it
    }
}</pre>

<p>That's a lot of boilerplate, and we haven't really gone into parameters which
define how the page will be displayed, templating boilerplate and pretty links.</p>
<h3><a name="mvc"></a>MVC</h3>

<p>MVC (Model, View, Controller) was a major breakthrough that allowed us to write
our code more efficiently with reusable components and logical separation.</p>
<p>An MVC framework allows you to separate your application to a <i>Model</i> which
handles your database connections - ORM-laden, usually, a <i>View</i> which handles
your output (usually through templates) with their configuration and preferences
and finally a <i>Controller</i> which contains your application logic.</p>
<p>This allows you to write scalable, clean, understandable, reusable code.</p>
<h2><a name="namespace_matching"></a>Namespace matching</h2>

<p>MVC relies on something we refer to as <i>namespace matching</i>, which means that
in order to dispatch a request to the correct code piece, the MVC framework will
have a (usually predetermined) destination according to your application's
namespace.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Catalyst">Catalyst</a>, for example, a request to <code>http://myapp/view/articles/30</code> will
be dispatched using the namespace <i>MyAppName::View</i> (as long as our app is
under a <i>MyApp</i> namespace) to the file <i>View.pm</i>, to the function <i>articles</i>
and will send <i>30</i> to as a first parameter to the function.</p>
<p>This easy logic allows Catalyst (and MVC frameworks) to be very accurate, but
also more rigid. Catalyst itself has many ways of making it much more flexible.</p>
<h2><a name="routes"></a>Routes</h2>

<p>Routes was an idea introduced by Ruby's <b>Sinatra</b> framework (which we often
credit) and takes a much cleaner and clearer approach to cut down on the
added hierarchy complexity that MVC can add.</p>
<p>Routes are basically paths the user takes which are attached to code that will
be triggered when a user reaches the specific route.</p>
<h3><a name="basic_dispatching"></a>Basic dispatching</h3>

<p>Imagine a user making a GET request to <i>/</i>. The following route will catch it
and execute the attached subroutine:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/' =&gt; sub { 'yay' };</pre>

<p>In <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer">Dancer</a>, every return value is actually the content the user will get - and
don't worry, you don't have to specify what the content type is, although you
can.</p>
<p>Usually you will render a template, and you can do that just as easy:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/' =&gt; sub { template 'index' };</pre>

<p>You'll notice that routes are very succinct and easy to read.</p>
<h3><a name="parameters"></a>Parameters</h3>

<p>The code that routes run do not get any parameters and instead rely on framework
keywords to get the information needed.  For example, to get the name of a user
in a form that was <i>POST</i>ed to a route:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">post '/login' =&gt; sub {
    return "Hello, ", params-&gt;{'name'};
};</pre>

<p>Routes are also able to specify variables in a given route, to allow for more
dynamic routes. Here is an article view route:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/view/article/:id' =&gt; sub {
    template 'article' =&gt; {
        entry = get_article( params-&gt;{'id'} ),
    };
};</pre>

<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer">Dancer</a> does not carry an ORM or DB bindings with it because it aspires to be
as lightweight as possible, but there are plugins which allow you to hook up to
schemas straight from your app. Check out <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::Database">Dancer::Plugin::Database</a> and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::DBIC">Dancer::Plugin::DBIC</a> for more on that.</p>
<h3><a name="regular_expressions"></a>Regular expressions</h3>

<p>Routes have much more to offer but in case you're not fully happy with the
default spec for routes, you can specify your own route in any way, shape or
form you find comfortable using regexes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get qr{ / view / articles / (\d+)(\.\d+)? }x =&gt; sub {
    # the matches can then be fetched using splat()
    my @matches = splat;
};</pre>

<p><i>(splat is a keyword that originated in Sinatra, blame them for the name :)</i></p>
<h3><a name="more"></a>More</h3>

<p>Routes actually have another thing or two up their sleeve (such as being able
to skip routes or filter routes by hostname or user agent strings), but you can
read all about it on <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer">Dancer</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Introduction">Dancer::Introduction</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>What we've gone over in this article is the difference between CGI programming,
MVC programming and route-based programming (which was introduced by the micro
web frameworks).</p>
<p>You may ask, however, what should you choose for your project? Which is the
best?</p>
<p>It's all a matter of choice and you first know that every project may be
different than the next. You might want to use Dancer for one project but prefer
to use Catalyst for another (and hopefully never use pure CGI for anything), and
that's perfectly fine, because that's what we do too. :)</p>
<p>The major benefit of route-based web programming is that it's much lighter,
requires no specific directory hierarchy or a strong separation of model and
view (since in Dancer you can configure both in the main config file in
two-three lines). It's easier and faster to get it up and running, that's for
sure. It's also here to stay.</p>
