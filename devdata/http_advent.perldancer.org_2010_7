The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<h2><a name="history_of_stateful_http"></a>History of stateful HTTP</h2>

<p>Since HTTP is a stateless protocol each request-response pair
is independent. There's no state kept between responses (hence <i>stateless</i>).
This feature of HTTP turned out to be both a blessing that allowed
the web to scale so well and a hoop to jump through for developers of
websites where the design requires keeping of state between page loads.</p>
<p>Well, this deficiency is a thing of the past since Netscape invented
HTTP cookies in 1994. Cookies provide an elegant way of emulating
application state by transferring a piece of data from server
out-of-band and keeping it on the client side. This piece is tied to a
particular set of web pages via its parameters and is sent alongside
each request from client back to server so that the server could
restore the state and serve the request in a particular context.</p>
<p>Early uses of cookies included shopping carts that stored a list of
selected goods right in the cookie until the purchase was completed.
Then personalised web came and lots of websites introduced "my"
sections (e.g. My Yahoo) which required users to sign up/sign in to
their accounts. Storing login credentials in cookies is
inherently insecure both for users who risk losing them to
eavesdroppers on open networks and for websites because cookies 
could be tampered with by malicious clients.</p>
<p>So sessions emerged. The trick is to store data securely in the
database while delivering a cookie with only a session identifier.
The identifiers are taken from a huge space so that guessing or
brute-forcing become infeasible. This is the most popular way of
implementing statefulness over HTTP since then.</p>
<h2><a name="problems_with_sessions"></a>Problems with sessions</h2>

<p>The problems arise with load. Each and every request inside a session
required a database query to retrieve the session data by its
identifier or to prove the session invalid. Usability concerns require
sessions to be long (all those "remember me on this computer"
check boxes) and that means a session store should have room for a huge
number of sessions while being sufficiently fast to serve a query for
each page hit.</p>
<p>Modern websites try to work around session storage problems by using
special storages like <i>Memcached</i> and there's a
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Session::Memcached">Dancer::Session::Memcached</a> plugin to implement such a scheme in a
Dancer application. That usually means replacing the database problems
with Memcached problems, like Memcached not being persistent between
reboots or not guaranteeing storage for any long period of time due to
being a cache and not a general purpose database.</p>
<h2><a name="using_cookies_more"></a>Using cookies more</h2>

<p>There's an old Russian saying - "everything new is well-forgotten
old" and that is exactly what is going on with storing sessions in
cookies like in the old times of first shopping carts. The trick is
that there is another good way of securing your sessions which does
not involve any database and that is <i>cryptography</i>. Server stores
session data on the client side in encrypted cookies.</p>
<p>Basically, server sends this HTTP header:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">Set-Cookie: s=base64(encrypt(serialize($session_hash)))</pre>

<p>Client will return this cookie with each subsequent request and server
will check the validity of the data by reversing all the operations it
performed when creating the cookie and verifying the embedded
checksum. It will then have the session data readily available without
any database access. Mismatched checksum means invalid (same as
expired) session and also gives a hint about a tampering attempt going
on.</p>
<p>Little can be added to this. This method is not new and is in
production use on some of the most loaded websites in the world for
years. It is a kind of well-kept secret of doing secure stateful HTTP
under heavy load. Personally, I tend to use it everywhere I can
because it is also simpler than creating a server-side session store.</p>
<p>The reason it is not used more widely, I think, lies in the frameworks
which power a large percentage of all new websites and do not
implement this mechanism. Fortunately, Dancer is not one of them.</p>
<h2><a name="using_cookies_to_store_sessions_in_dancer"></a>Using cookies to store sessions in Dancer</h2>

<p>The session plugin <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Session::Cookie">Dancer::Session::Cookie</a> implements encrypted
cookies storage for sessions in a Dancer application. I wrote it more
than a year ago and it had very little changes since then because it's
very simple and there's little room for bugs to fix or for
improvements.</p>
<p>To install the plugin you will need three modules from CPAN which are
not in base perl distribution: <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Crypt::Rijndael">Crypt::Rijndael</a>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Crypt::CBC">Crypt::CBC</a> for
encryption/decryption and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/String::CRC32">String::CRC32</a> for the checksum which is
used to validate sessions.</p>
<p>After installation, add these lines to your <i>config.yml</i>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">session: "cookie"
session_cookie_key: "random encryption key"</pre>

<p>You should initialise your <b>session_cookie_key</b> with a random string of 16
or more characters right away to ensure the uniqueness of your
encryption. You should also implement protection for <i>config.yml</i> by
setting some permissions and not pushing it to GitHub :) Compromised
encryption key may potentially lead to all sorts of bad things.</p>
<p>Session expiration may be implemented on both sides. First, by using a
built-in expiration features of HTTP cookies. But since the client is
not trusted you can also save session creation time right inside that
session and check it when you validate sessions. Automatic expiration is not
implemented in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Session::Cookie">Dancer::Session::Cookie</a>, patches are welcome.</p>
<p>There's a limit on the size of cookies but it varies across browsers.
A good practical limit to use is 4096 bytes - supported in all major
browsers for a long time. This is plenty of space and if your sessions
do not fit this is probably a sign of something strange happening.</p>
